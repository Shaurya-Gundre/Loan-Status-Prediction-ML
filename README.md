Loan Status Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview:-
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, education, credit history, and property area.
It is a binary classification problem where the target variable is Loan_Status.

Dataset Information:-
The dataset contains 614 loan application records with 13 features including:
Gender
Married
Dependents
Education
Self_Employed
ApplicantIncome
CoapplicantIncome
LoanAmount
Loan_Amount_Term
Credit_History
Property_Area
Loan_Status (Target Variable)

Technologies Used:-
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Machine Learning Model:-
Logistic Regression was used for classification because the target variable is binary (Approved / Not Approved).

Model Performance:-
Accuracy: 78.86%
Evaluation Metrics:
Confusion Matrix
Precision
Recall
F1-Score

How to Run the Project:-
1]Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2]Install required libraries.
3]Run all cells sequentially.
4]The model will train and display accuracy results.

Conclusion:-
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 78.86%, demonstrating good performance for structured tabular classification problems like loan prediction.
